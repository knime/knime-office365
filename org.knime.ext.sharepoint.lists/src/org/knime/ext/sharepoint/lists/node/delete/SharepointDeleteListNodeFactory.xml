	<name>Delete SharePoint Online List</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Deletes a SharePoint Online list.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
				This node deletes a SharePoint list.
			</p>
		</intro>
		<tab name="Settings">
			<option name="SharePoint site">
				There are three ways to specify SharePoint site:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i>Root site:</i>
						Connect to the root site of the domain of the current user (see
						"Microsoft Connection" input port).
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Web URL:</i>
						Specify the web URL of a SharePoint site, for example
						<i>https://mycompany.sharepoint.com</i>
						.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Group site:</i>
						Connect to the team site of a particular Office 365 group.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>
			<option name="Subsite">
				If checked, then connect to a (nested) subsite of the SharePoint site
				specified above. Use the "Refresh" button to list all available
				subsites
				of the chosen SharePoint site. Note that this allows you only to
				access the document libraries of the subsite, not those of the
				parent site(s).
			</option>
			<option name="SharePoint list">
				Here you can select the list you want to delete. The drop down menu
				shows lists in the format <tt>&lt;display-name&gt; (&lt;internal-name&gt;)</tt>.
				The display name is a user-chosen name, which is editable in
				SharePoint, whereas the internal name is fixed and auto-generated by
				SharePoint. In addition to that the node also stores a unique technical ID (not
				visible). If you pick a list from the dropdown, the node will store
				all these three values,
				and upon execution, the node will first try to delete a list with the
				unique technical ID. If such a list does not exist, the node will
				try to delete a list
				with the configured internal name.
			</option>
		</tab>
		<tab name="Advanced">
			<option name="Connection timeout in seconds">
				Timeout in seconds to establish a connection or 0 for an infinite timeout.
			</option>
			<option name="Read timeout in seconds">
				Timeout in seconds to read data from an established connection or 0 for an
				infinite timeout.
			</option>
