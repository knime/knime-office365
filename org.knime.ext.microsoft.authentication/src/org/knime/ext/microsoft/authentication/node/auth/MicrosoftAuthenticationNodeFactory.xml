	<shortDescription>
        Provides authentication to access against Microsoft Office 365 cloud services, such as SharePoint Online.

		<intro>
			<p>
				This node provides authentication to access Microsoft Office 365 cloud services, such as SharePoint Online.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The node supports these authentication modes:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i>Interactive authentication</i>: Allows to perform a interactive, web browser based login by by clicking on <i>Login</i>
						in the node dialog. In the browser window that pops up, you may be asked to consent to the requested level of access
						The login results in a token being stored in a configurable location. The token will be valid for a certain amount of time
						that is defined by your Azure AD settings. 
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Username/password authentication</i>: Performs a non-interactive login to obtain a fresh token every time the node executes.
						Since this login is non-interactive and you get a fresh token every time, this mode is well-suited for workflows on KNIME Server.
						However, it also has some limitations: First, you cannot to consent to the requested level of access, hence consent must be 
						given beforehand, e.g. during a previous interactive login, or by an Azure AD directory admin. Second, accounts that require
						multi-factor authentication (MFA) will not work.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Azure Storage shared key authentication</i>: <b>Specific to Azure Blob Storage</b>. Performs authentication using storage account
						and the secret key.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Azure Storage SAS token authentication</i>: <b>Specific to Azure Blob Storage</b>. Perfroms authentication using shared access signature (SAS) URL.
						For more details see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview">documentation</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

		<tab name="Interactive authentication">

			<option name="Login">
				Click <i>Login</i> to open a browser window, where you can login with your Microsoft identity and, if necessary, consent to the
				requested access level (see below). The login results in a <i>token</i> being stored in a configurable location (see below).
			</option>

			<option name="Token storage">
				Allows to define where the token obtained during login gets stored:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Memory</b>: The token is temporarily stored in-memory. The token will be removed
						once the workflow is closed.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>File</b>: Allows to specify a file where the token will be written to (in encrypted form) upon login, and read from
						when the node is executed. This allows the same token to be used by nodes in different workflows. Note that the file
						is (over)written every time you successfully login.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Node</b>: The token is persistently stored (in encrypted form) in the settings of this node and will be saved with
						the workflow.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>
			
			<option name="Clear selected">
				Clears the token from the currently selected storage. Please note that when <b>File</b> is selected as storage, then the
				specified file will be deleted.
			</option>

			<option name="Clear all">
				Clears the token from all selected storages. Please note that any file specified in the <b>File</b> storage option will be deleted.

			<option name="Username">
				Provide the username of your Microsoft identity (typically an email address).
			</option>
			
			<option name="Password">
				Provide the password of your Microsoft identity. <i>Warning:</i> The password will be stored in weakly encrypted
				form as part of the node settings in the workflow.
			</option>
			
			<option name="Credentials flow variable">
				Allows to choose a credentials flow variable that provides the username and password to login with.
