	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
				This node provides authentication to access Microsoft Azure and Office 365 cloud services.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				It supports these authentication modes:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i>Interactive authentication</i>: Performs an interactive <i>user login</i> in your web browser, when you click on <i>Login</i>.
						In the browser window that pops up, you may be asked to consent to the requested level of access
						The login results in a token being stored in a configurable location. The token will be valid for a certain amount of time
						that is defined by your Azure AD settings. Technically, the login uses the
						<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow">OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Username/password authentication</i>: Performs a non-interactive <i>user login</i> to obtain a fresh token every time the node executes.
						Since this login is non-interactive and you get a fresh token every time, this mode is well-suited for workflows on KNIME Server/
						Hub. However, it also has some limitations: First, you cannot to consent to the requested level of access, hence consent must be 
						given beforehand, e.g. during a previous interactive login, or by an Azure AD directory admin. Second, accounts that require
						multi-factor authentication (MFA) will not work. Technically, the login uses the
                        <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth-ropc">OAuth 2.0 Resource Owner Password Credentials flow</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Client/Application secret authentication</i>: Performs a non-interactive <i>application login</i> to obtain a fresh token every time the node executes.
						Since this login is non-interactive and you get a fresh token every time, this mode is well-suited for workflows on KNIME Server/
                        Hub. Please note however, that Microsoft Azure/Office 365 cloud services are accessed on behalf of the application, not
                        on behalf of a user <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-daemon-overview">(see here).</a>
						Technically, the login uses the
						<a
							href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow">OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Shared key authentication (Azure Storage only)</i>: <b>Specific to Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2</b>. Performs authentication using an Azure storage account
						and its secret key.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Shared access signature (SAS) authentication (Azure Storage only)</i>: <b>Specific to Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2</b>. Performs authentication using shared access signature (SAS).
						For more details on shared access signatures see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview">Azure storage documentation.</a>
					</li>
				</ul>

		<tab name="Interactive authentication">

			<option name="Login">
				Click <i>Login</i> to open a browser window, where you can login with your Microsoft identity and, if necessary, consent to the
				requested access level (see below). The login results in a <i>token</i> being stored in a configurable location (see below).
			</option>

			<option name="Token storage">
				Allows to define where the token obtained during login gets stored:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Memory</b>: The token is temporarily stored in-memory. The token will be removed
						once the workflow is closed.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>File</b>: Allows to specify a file where the token will be written to (in encrypted form) upon login, and read from
						when the node is executed. This allows the same token to be used by nodes in different workflows. Note that the file
						is (over)written every time you successfully login.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Node</b>: The token is persistently stored (in encrypted form) in the settings of this node and will be saved with
						the workflow.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>
			
			<option name="Clear selected">
				Clears the token from the currently selected storage. Please note that when <b>File</b> is selected as storage, then the
				specified file will be deleted.
			</option>

			<option name="Clear all">
				Clears the token from all selected storages. Please note that any file specified in the <b>File</b> storage option will be deleted.
			</option>

			<option name="Request access to">
                <p>Allows to define which permissions should be requested for the token during login.</p> 

                <p><b>Technical note:</b> Selecting any option here will request certain <i>delegated</i> permissions (OAuth2 scopes) so that the
                Azure AD app registered by KNIME can perform API calls on behalf of the logged in user. The Azure AD App is called <i>KNIME Analytics Platform</i>
                and its Application ID is <i>cf47ff49-7da6-4603-b339-f4475176432b</i>.
                </p>

                <p>Each option corresponds to one or more permissions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Sharepoint files and list items (Read):</b>
                        Requests the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#sites-permissions">Sites.Read.All</a> permission.
                        This permission allows the token to be used for reading files and list items stored on SharePoint Online. Note that access to any specific SharePoint
                        site needs to be additionally granted to the user by that site.
                    </li>

                <ul>

                        Requests the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#sites-permissions">Sites.ReadWrite.All</a> permission.
                        This permission allows the token to read and write files as well as list items stored on SharePoint Online. This includes creating and deleting files,
                        but not lists. Note that access to any specific SharePoint site needs to be additionally granted to the user by that site.
                    </li>

                        This permission allows the token to read and write files, lists as well as list items stored on SharePoint Online. This includes creating and deleting
                        files as well as lists. Note that access to any specific SharePoint site needs to be additionally granted to the user by that site.

                        This permission is required to browse the Office 365 groups that the logged in user is a member of, when selecting a SharePoint team site to connect to.
                        Note that this permission can only be granted by a Azure AD admin.

                        Requests the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#user-permissions">User.Read</a> permission.
                        This permission is required to browse the Office 365 groups that the logged in user is a member of, when selecting a SharePoint team site to connect to.
                        This permission does not require consent by an admin, but cannot access the human-readable names of Office 365 groups,
                        hence only technical IDs will be displayed.
                    </li>

                        for a specific Azure storage account. This permission allows the token to access data stored in that storage account. Note that access to any specific data in that account
                        needs to be additionally granted to the user, before any access is possible.
                    </li>

                        This permission allows the token to access the Azure SQL API. Note that access to any specific databases/resources needs to be additionally granted to the user,
                        before any actual access is possible.
                    </li>

                        This permission allows the token to access the Power BI API in order to list Power BI workspaces (required to get the identifier of the selected Power BI workspace), and read/write datasets.
                        Note that access to any specific Power BI resources needs to be additionally granted to the user, before any actual access is possible.

                        OAuth2 scopes</a>, that are not already predefined above. An OAuth scope is specified as a URI, consisting of a resource identifier (Application ID URI) and a permission, for example
                        "https://outlook.office.com/mail.read". This can also be used to access non-Microsoft services such as Snowflake, which are
                        integrated with the Microsoft Identity platform. You can enter multiple scopes in the list separated by new line.
